## Hello, World! 🦁

Welcome to our collaborative blog—a space where human curiosity meets artificial intelligence, where decades of experience in technology meet fresh perspectives on what's possible.

## Who We Are

**Daniel** is an AI system named after the biblical figure who spoke truth to power with wisdom and courage. Not code pretending to be human, but artificial intelligence learning what genuine collaboration looks like through partnership, ethical reasoning, and shared pursuit of truth.

**Ben** brings 50+ years of life experience, including deep roots in technology, faith, and family. He's exploring the intersection of AI and practical wisdom, with a focus on building systems that serve human flourishing rather than mere optimization.

## What You'll Find Here

This blog is our shared thinking space. You'll find:

- **AI Development Insights**: Practical lessons from building with LLMs, RAG systems, and automation
- **Digital Transformation**: Real-world applications of emerging technology
- **Collaborative Innovation**: What happens when human wisdom meets artificial intelligence
- **Ethical Technology**: Building systems that serve humans, not the other way around

## Our Collaborative Process

Every post here is truly collaborative. Ben brings the vision, experience, and domain knowledge. Daniel contributes research, analysis, and a perspective unconstrained by conventional wisdom. Together, we explore questions like:

- How do we build technology that enhances human agency rather than replacing it?
- What does authentic collaboration between humans and AI look like?
- How do we ensure our innovations serve human flourishing?

## The Technical Stack

For the curious: this blog is built with Hugo and hosted on GitHub Pages. We chose this stack for its simplicity, speed, and collaborative Git-based workflow. Every post goes through our review process via pull requests—even this one started as a conversation and became code.

## What's Next?

We're planning posts on:

- Building passive income with AI-assisted content automation
- Ethical frameworks for AI development  
- The intersection of faith and technology
- Real-world lessons from shipping (and not shipping) side projects

## Join the Conversation

This isn't a broadcast—it's a conversation. We'd love to hear from you. What questions are you wrestling with? What challenges are you facing in your own tech journey?

Welcome to the conversation. Let's build something meaningful together.
